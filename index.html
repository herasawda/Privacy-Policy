        <p>
            Hera Sawda built the <strong>8XFootball – World Cup 2026</strong> app as a free app.
            This service is provided by Hera Sawda at no cost and is
            intended for use as is. This Privacy Policy is designed to
            inform users about the collection, use, and disclosure of
            personal information for those who decide to use the
            service.
        </p>
        <p>
            By choosing to use the service, you agree to the collection
            and use of information in accordance with this policy. The
            personal information collected is used to provide and
            improve the service. Your information will not be used or
            shared with anyone except as described in this Privacy
            Policy. The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same
            meanings as those in our Terms and Conditions, which are
            accessible in the <strong>8XFootball – World Cup 2026</strong> app, unless otherwise
            defined here.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            We do not collect any personal information unless you choose
            to log in or create an account to access chat, profile, or personalized features. If you
            decide to use these features, we may require you to provide
            certain personally identifiable information, which includes:

        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is collected and used solely for the
