                Hera Sawda built the BX Football Score App as a free app.
                This service is provided by Hera Sawda at no cost and is
                intended for use as is. This Privacy Policy is designed to
                inform users about the collection, use, and disclosure of
                personal information for those who decide to use the
                service.
            </p>
            <p>
                By choosing to use the service, you agree to the collection
                and use of information in accordance with this policy. The
                personal information collected is used to provide and
                improve the service. Your information will not be used or
                shared with anyone except as described in this Privacy
                Policy. The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same
                meanings as those in our Terms and Conditions, which are
                accessible in the BX Football Score App, unless otherwise
                defined here.
            </p>
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
                We do not collect any personal information unless you choose
                to log in to access the chat and profile features. If you
                decide to use these features, we may require you to provide
                certain personally identifiable information, which includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Phone number for OTP (One-Time Password) based login
                    authentication
                </li>
                <li>
                    Access to device gallery for updating profile images
                </li>
                <li>
                    Access to device camera for capturing and updating
                    profile images
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This information is collected and used solely for the
                purpose of providing and improving the chat and profile
                features. You can use the basic features of the app without
                logging in or providing any personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The phone number is collected and used solely for the
                purpose of authentication and securing your account. Gallery
                and camera access permissions are requested only when you
                choose to update your profile image, and these permissions
                can be revoked through your device settings at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app does utilize third-party services that may collect
                information used to identify you. Third-party service
                providers include:

                <li>Apple App Store Services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
       We use AppsFlyer for app analytics with privacy protection. 
We do not collect advertising identifiers, device IDs, or 
other personal device information from any users.
            </p>
            <h2>Account Deletion and Data Removal</h2>
            <p>
                If you have created an account to use the chat and profile
                features, you have the right to request the deletion of your
                account and associated data at any time. When you choose to
                delete your account:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All your personal information will be permanently
                    deleted from our databases
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your profile information and any uploaded content will
                    be removed from our servers
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your account credentials and authentication data will be
                    permanently erased
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To delete your account, you can use the account deletion
                option in the app settings. Once initiated, the deletion
                process cannot be reversed, and all data will be permanently
                removed from our systems.
            </p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                We value your trust in providing your personal information
                that are mentioned above, and strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect it.
            </p>
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                For users in the United States and on Apple platforms: This
                app is not directed to children under the age of 4. For
                children between the ages of 4, the app requires parental
                consent for account creation. Parents or legal guardians
                must review and approve the Privacy Policy on behalf of
                their children.

                For Android and all other platforms: This service is not
                directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
                collect personally identifiable information from children
                under 13 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we discover that a child under the applicable age limit
                has provided us with personal information, we will
                immediately delete this information. If you are a parent or
                guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
                with personal information, please contact us so that we can
                take necessary actions.
